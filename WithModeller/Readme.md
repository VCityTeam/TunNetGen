### Blender tricks
* [Increase vertices to a cylinder](https://blender.stackexchange.com/questions/193384/i-want-to-increase-the-number-of-vertices-in-a-cylinder)
* [Deleting faces](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=At23FTDEu7E): select the face and use the `x` key
* [Selecting the edge loops](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/2.79/modeling/meshes/selecting/edges_faces.html) (that is edges on the boundary of a surface)

* Showing the [number of selected primitives](https://blender.stackexchange.com/questions/145032/the-number-of-objects-selected) (vertices, edges, faces):
 go in the 3D Viewport to the top right under Viewport Overlays (icon is an open circle intersecting a closed circle) and enable the Statistics checkbox.

## Modeling notes
* The border of half an isocahedron sphere parametrized with a depth recursion
  of 5 levels has 40 edges.
